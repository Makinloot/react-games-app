# react-games-app
<p>I re-created this app from my project called games (https://github.com/Makinloot/games)</p>
<p>This version is without Node JS, only React and Typescript</p>
<p>(After 1024px in developement mode please reload page in Game component to make responsive work)</p>

To run this app locally you need to:
    <p>• run 'npm install' in root directory</p>
    <p>• Get RAWG api key from https://rawg.io/apidocs</p>
    <p>• Create settings.json file in root directory</p>
    <p>• Add following object in settings.json:</p>
    {"RAWG_KEY": "YOUR_API_KEY"}
